# Basic and Advanced Programming

## Introduction:
Hi there, welcome to this repo. These are some of the basic and advanced programming tips or techniques that I studied from my university. I will update more and more exercise here. Thanks for taking a look !

**NOTE: I'm not sure that my program runs properly, maybe there are some logical bugs, please feel free to contact me or open issues to fix these bugs. Thank you very much !**

PLEASE GIVE MY CREDIT OR MENTION ME `@teddythinh` WHEN USING. THANKS !☺️☺️☺️
